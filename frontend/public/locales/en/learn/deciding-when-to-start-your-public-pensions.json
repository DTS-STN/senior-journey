The CPP lets you choose when to start your retirement pension, and each month you delay increases your monthly amount. The highest monthly amount you can receive happens at age 70, after which there is no benefit to waiting. If you need money sooner, you can start collecting your pension as early as age 60, but with a permanent reduction.",
