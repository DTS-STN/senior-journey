Each year that you work and contribute while collecting your retirement pension, up to age 70, will generate a new benefit that starts the following year and is added to your CPP income, even if you're already receiving the maximum pension. Like the retirement pension, post-retirement benefits are payable for life and indexed to the cost of living once per year. When you reach age 65, you can choose to stop making post-retirement contributions. This won't affect any post-retirement benefits you are already receiving, but will stop you from earning new ones.",
