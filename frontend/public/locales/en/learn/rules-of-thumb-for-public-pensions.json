    "li10": "you continue to work, and your salary is enough to cover your needs",
    "li11": "you continue to work and want to cover the time of low contributions to the CPP when you were either in school or working outside of Canada, or changing your career",
    "li12": "you can support your current lifestyle by using your retirement savings and don't need to collect your CPP retirement pension now",

    "li9": "you are in good health and expect a long, healthy retirement",
    "p1": "The CPP lets you choose when to start your retirement pension, and each month you delay increases your monthly amount. The highest monthly amount you can receive happens at age 70, after which there is no benefit to waiting. If you need money sooner, you can start collecting your pension as early as age 60, but with a permanent reduction.",
    "p2": "While starting early may give you more money now, it means less CPP over your lifetime for most Canadians. In fact, for some it could mean leaving $100,000 on the table over their lifetime. Your pension will also be adjusted for inflation. This means it will reflect the most current cost of living.",
