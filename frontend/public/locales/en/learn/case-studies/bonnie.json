      "li1": "When you start your retirement, you should think about all your income sources and how they will work together.",
      "li2": "As a rule of thumb, most experts say people about 60-70% of their total pre-retirement income (before taxes) to have a comfortable retirement.",
      "li3": "While you may spend your savings more quickly in the short term to fill the gap that comes from delaying the start of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) pension, the higher amount will make up for this over the longer term.",
      "li4": "You'll use less of your personal savings over time.",
      "li5": "Think about inflation while you're retirement planning. Your Old Age Security (OAS) and CPP pensions will adjust for inflation, but your private savings and investments might not.",
      "li6": "The argument to delay your public pensions is stronger if inflation is high.",
      "smart-tip": "<strong>Smart tip:</strong> If you qualify for the Old Age Security (OAS) pension and have low income, you may also get the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS). People who qualify for the GIS should not wait to apply past age 65. You cannot receive the GIS if you are delaying your OAS pension."

      "p1": "Bonnie worked in marketing for over 35 years. During that time, she saved for her retirement. When she leaves her job, Bonnie will drive less, need less work clothes and can cook at home more. These changes in lifestyle will lower her monthly cost of living.",
      "p2": "Bonnie is now 60 years old, and her full-time salary is $67,000 per year or $5,583 per month before taxes. She would like to go part-time at age 63 and then fully retire at age 65. Bonnie is healthy now and decides to plan for the next 28 years - which is the average lifespan of a Canadian woman who is 60 this year.",
      "p3": "Bonnie's goal in retirement is to generally maintain her current lifestyle - and so, she'll be looking at how to do that. As part of this, she'll need to decide when to start her OAS and CPP pensions because it will change how and when she uses her savings.",
      "smart-tip": "<strong>Smart tip:</strong> Longevity is an important factor when taking your pensions. Most Canadians underestimate how long they'll live, and many are at risk of outliving their savings. On average, Canadians who are age 65 today can expect to <a1>live up to 86 years for men and 88 years for women</a1>. That's why they need to plan for at least another 20-25 years. In fact, there is about 50% chance that those who go into retirement today will live up to age 90. And every 10th woman will live up to age 100. It's good to have a financial plan for these years of life.",
