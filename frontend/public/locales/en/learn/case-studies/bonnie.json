Remember, she needed $528,000 in savings if she chose to take her CPP at age 70. Bonnie will need to save <strong>$51,000</strong> more if she wants to take her CPP retirement pension earlier than if she delays it. As taxes are usually lower in retirement, Bonnie might need less in private savings.",

    "p1": "Bonnie worked in marketing for over 35 years. During that time, she saved for her retirement. When she leaves her job, Bonnie will drive less, need less work clothes and can cook at home more. These changes in lifestyle will lower her monthly cost of living.",
    "p2": "Bonnie is now 60 years old. Her full-time salary is $67,000 per year or $5,583 per month. She would like to go part-time at age 63 and then fully retire at age 65. Bonnie is healthy now and decides to plan for the next 28 years – which is the average lifespan of a Canadian woman who is 60 this year.",
    "p3": "Bonnie's goal in retirement is to generally maintain her current lifestyle - and so, she'll be looking at how to do that. As part of this, she'll need to decide when to start her OAS and CPP pensions because it will change how and when she uses her savings.",
    "smart-tip": "<strong>Smart tip:</strong> Longevity is an important factor when taking your pensions. Most Canadians underestimate how long they'll live, and many are at risk of outliving their savings. On average, Canadians who are age 65 today can expect to <a1>live up to 86 years for men and 88 years for women</a1>. That's why they need to plan for at least another 20-25 years. In fact, there is <a2>about 50% chance</a2> that those who go into retirement today will live up to age 90. It's good to have a financial plan for these years of life."

She uses her earnings from work, both her public pensions, and her retirement savings to reach her target monthly income from ages 60 to 88. This chart shows Bonnie works full-time from ages 60 to 62. She then goes part-time from ages 63 to 64 and her earnings are half of what they used to be. Bonnie uses some of her retirement savings to reach her target monthly income. Bonnie fully retires at age 65 and uses her retirement savings and the OAS pension to reach her target monthly income until age 70. From ages 70 to 88, Bonnie uses all her income sources including her CPP retirement pension to reach her target monthly income. The graph shows that from ages 70 to 88 the CPP retirement pension and retirement savings make up the most of her retirement income.
