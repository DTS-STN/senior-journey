    "p": "Fred wants to take the largest pensions from the OAS pension and CPP retirement pension available to him. To do this correctly, he evaluated both his monthly and his lifetime pensions. He considered how long he is going to collect his pensions and he looked how much he can collect from the CPP retirement pension and OAS pension by age 86 or 89. Fred can afford to delay his pensions and is planning to work part-time at the start of retirement. He would not be eligible to collect the GIS. Thinking about all these factors, Fred decided to delay his CPP retirement pension until age 70 and OAS pension until age 68. This would provide him with the highest monthly and lifetime pensions."
