    "p1": "Keith is working later in retirement and plans to stay on the job until age 70. He might not need the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension income immediately and does not qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS). He wants to take the largest pensions from the Old Age Security (OAS) and CPP retirement pensions available to him. He would like to know how he can use Post-Retirement Benefits (PRBs), if he chooses to take CPP before he retires from his job.",
    "p2": "Keith decided to start CPP at age 65 and continue contributing to age 70, receiving 5 PRBs. This choice will give a high monthly pension that will be topped up annually with up to 5 additional PRBs. And it will provide the largest lifetime pension by age 87 and 90.",
    "p3": "Keith also decides to delay his OAS pension until age 70. The higher monthly benefit will help when he retires from work."

He has two potential sources of income between his CPP retirement pension and his Post-Retirement Benefits. For all choices, the CPP retirement pension makes up the most of his monthly income. Taking his CPP at age 70 is the largest amount of monthly income. Taking his CPP at age 60 and continuing to work for 5 years to receive 5 Post-Retirement Benefits is the smallest amount of monthly income.",

However, the PRBs will accumulate slowly during the years when Keith continues to work and contribute. Each year of additional contributions to the plan will result in an additional small top-up to the existing pension and benefits next year. The graph compares the pension at age 70 for different choices, and the amounts are quite different.",
      "p2": "Choices 3 and 4 are about Keith taking his CPP retirement pension later in life, at age 65 and 70, and receiving higher monthly pension amounts. Keith would like to choose his strategy between these two options. For both options, Keith knows he will continue paying contributions until age 70."
