      "p1": "You can start collecting your pensions while you're still working or as soon as you stop working.",
      "p2": "You cannot start your OAS pension earlier than age 65. You can receive your CPP retirement pension early but starting it earlier than age 65 will mean a smaller monthly amount for life. Starting your pension early can give you money sooner if you need it.",
      "p3": "Some people might start collecting one pension earlier than the other. For example, you could start collecting your OAS pension when you first work less hours. Then start your CPP retirement pension later when you're no longer working.",
      "p4": "If you work while collecting your CPP retirement pension, and are not yet 70 years old, you could qualify for the CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB). For each year that you work and contribute to CPP, you will receive a small top-up that will be added to your monthly pension amount.",
      "p5": "Like the CPP retirement pension, the amount of the PRB is adjusted based on your age. If you are younger than 65, the PRB will be lower. If you are older than 65, the amount will be higher.",
      "p6": "When you reach age 65, you can choose to stop contributing to the PRB. To find out more about how this process works, visit the <a1>Post-Retirement Benefit</a1> page.",

      "oas-tax-link": "https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/old-age-security/recovery-tax.html",
      "p1": "Delaying your OAS pension and CPP retirement pensions will increase your monthly amount until age 70. If you have good earnings from work and other sources of income, you may choose to delay. If you wait longer to start your public pensions, your monthly amount will be higher in retirement.",
      "p2": "While you wait to start collecting your public pensions, you may need to use income from work or some of your retirement savings. You may need to use a bit more of your retirement savings in the short term. Still, you will collect a higher monthly amount for the rest of your life. In fact, waiting might even mean you use less of your retirement savings in the long run. This is especially true because your public pensions adjust for inflation.",
      "p3": "The CPP and OAS are two different pension programs. You can choose to start one but delay the other.",
      "p4": "Read <a1>Bonnie delays to reduce the savings she needs</a1>. Bonnie has retirement savings and decides to wait longer before taking her public pensions."

    "p1": "You may be surprised to learn that you don't have to stop working to collect your Old Age Security (OAS) pension or Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension. Combining income from work with public pensions can be a useful strategy as people move towards retirement."

    "p1": "Over the years the idea of retirement has changed. Today, for many, retirement isn't a single point in time where you stop working, but a gradual transition. People continue to work later in life for many reasons. For some, they simply love their job and don't plan on retiring anytime soon. Others like to socialize during work. For others, they work longer for financial reasons or obligations. One way to think about your potential choices in retirement is to consider the following paths:",
    "p2": "These aren't the only possible paths, and some may even mix and match. Some people might change from one path to another over their retirement. For example, someone in full retirement might miss the social engagement and return to part-time work, or start a small side business."
