    "p1": "(FR) When you retire, you may need less money per month than what you need now. You might not need to drive as much, have less work-related spending, reduced child-related and housing costs. With more free time, you might want to travel more, or do some renovations in your house. Everyone's retirement looks different, so it's important to think about what you want and plan for it. Think about things like your health, where you want to live, and how much money you'll have from pensions and savings.  Generally, you won't need as much as you do now to keep your way of living. Many financial planners say that having 60 to 70% of your current income in retirement will allow you to maintain your lifestyle in retirement. But, this rule of thumb doesn't work for everyone. If you have <a1>low income</a1>, you might need the same amount of money when you retire as you do now to cover all your basic needs. The <a2>Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)</a2> is an important source of income for low-income retirees. People with higher income may only need have 50 to 60% of their current income in retirement. Think about your personal situation when planning for retirement, so you can save the right amount.",

In early retirement, you may want extra money to travel, or pursue hobbies that you didn't have the time for during your working years. As you get older, you may find your spending habits shift. You may spend less money on shopping or going out, and more on healthcare, medications, and home care.",
