These public pensions provide a base upon which seniors can add income from other sources, such as employer-sponsored pension plans, registered retirement savings plans, tax-free savings accounts and other private savings, to meet their financial needs in retirement.",
      "paragraph-1": "(FR) If you choose to continue to work while collecting your retirement pension, you can also benefit from the CPP Post-Retirement Benefit. Each year that you work and contribute while collecting your retirement pension, up to age 70, will generate a new benefit that starts the following year and is added to your CPP income, even if you're already receiving the maximum pension. Like the retirement pension, post-retirement benefits are payable for life and indexed to the cost of living once per year. When you reach age 65, you can choose to stop making post-retirement contributions. This won't affect any post-retirement benefits you are already receiving, but will stop you from earning new ones.",

      "paragraph-3": "(FR) The standard age for the CPP retirement pension is 65; however, the Plan provides you with flexibility based on your needs and circumstances. You can begin your pension as early as age 60 by accepting a permanent reduction, or, you can permanently increase your monthly amount by delaying the pension up to age 70. To learn more about early and deferred pensions, visit the website [link on this website] There is no need to stop working in order to begin your pension.",
