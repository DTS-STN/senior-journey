On average, Canadians who are age 65 today can expect to <a1>live at least another 20 years</a1>.

If you need money sooner, you can start collecting your pension as early as age 60, but with a permanent reduction.",
    "p2": "(FR) While starting early may give you more money now, it means less CPP over your lifetime for most Canadians. In fact, for some it could mean leaving $100,000 on the table over their lifetime. Your pension will also be adjusted for inflation. This means it will reflect the most current cost of living.",
