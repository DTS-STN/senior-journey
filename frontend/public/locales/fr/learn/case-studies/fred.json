Fred also thinks that he might outlive his parents, as he is quite healthy now. His dad passed away at 87, and his mother is still alive at age 91. He has received a letter from Service Canada. This letter explains that he is now eligible to apply for his CPP retirement pension. At age 65, his expected CPP pension amount is $1,300 a month. He will qualify for the maximum OAS pension as well, but he would not qualify for the GIS. He is curious about his options to take pensions earlier or choose to wait longer.",
