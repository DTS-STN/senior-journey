Bonnie is healthy now and decides to plan for the next 28 years - which is the average lifespan of a Canadian woman who is 60 this year.",
    "p3": "(FR) Bonnie's goal in retirement is to generally maintain her current lifestyle - and so, she'll be looking at how to do that. As part of this, she'll need to decide when to start her OAS and CPP pensions because it will change how and when she uses her savings.",
    "smart-tip": "(FR) <strong>Smart tip:</strong> Longevity is an important factor when taking your pensions. Most Canadians underestimate how long they'll live, and many are at risk of outliving their savings. On average, Canadians who are age 65 today can expect to <a1>live up to 86 years for men and 88 years for women</a1>. That's why they need to plan for at least another 20-25 years. In fact, there is <a2>about 50% chance</a2> that those who go into retirement today will live up to age 90. It's good to have a financial plan for these years of life.",
